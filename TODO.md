# TODO: Add Printing Animation to #paper

- [x] Add CSS animation for .printEffect in cameraStyle.css to simulate printing (e.g., slide in from top with fade-in)
- [x] Add CSS animation for .deleteEffect in cameraStyle.css to simulate deletion (e.g., slide out or fade-out)
- [x] Test the animation by capturing an image in the camera component (server running on http://localhost:5174/)
