            <p id="storyParagraph">I'm Rainy, a Senior UX Designer at MAQ Software with 6+ years of experience. My design journey began in 2016 at NIFT, where I studied Fashion Communication and explored photography, graphics, UI/UX, research, and visual storytelling.</p>
            <p id="storyParagraph">
                I started my career as a Visual Designer at a startup now <mark>RentOk</mark>, where I unexpectedly discovered my passion for UX while designing an internal tool. That interest shaped my path, leading me to build projects, strengthen my skills, and move into product design roles at Internshala and later UtilizeCore, where I focused heavily on design systems.</p>
            <p id="storyParagraph">
                In 2022, I joined MAQ Software for onsite experience and have since designed internal products, complex analytical dashboards, and collaborated directly with global clients like Microsoft, PepsiCo, Staples, and Wolters Kluwer. Over the years, I've grown into one of the top performers on the design team and now work as a Senior UX Designer.
